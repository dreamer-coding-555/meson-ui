# The Meson-UI Build GUI

## Overview

Meson-UI is an open source build GUI meant to be both extremely fast,
and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.

The main design point of Meson-UI is that every moment a developer spends
writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every
second spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling
code.

## Features

*   Multiplatform support for **Linux**, **MacOS X**, **Windows 10**, and others
*   Straight forward and easy to use graphical user interface
*   Supported almost all of Meson build command line arguments
*   Basic support for managing wraps from Meson-UI
*   Available as a package on Python Package Index
*   Available as a Snap on the linux Snap Store
*   Optimized for extremely fast usage without sacrificing correctness
*   Distributed under the Apache 2.0 license
*   Works 99.95% out of the box
*   fun!
